# Description
pfas-precursor-biotransformation is a four box model used to determine the fate
of six-carbon polylfluoroalkyl sulfonamido precursor transformation into PFHxS
in laboratory microcosms representative of the groundwater/surface water
boundary. A conceptual schematic of the model is provided in
'conceptual_model.pdf'. The model can be run in the file
'FHxSA_box_model.ipynb', which shows scenario of FHxSA biotransformation into
PFHxS.
